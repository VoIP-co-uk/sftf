- fix Helper.importModule() for hirachical module loading
- change createEvent by default to False and lets do it at
  writeMessageToNetwork() ?!
- maybe 302 can be used for "endless" testing of INVITES for some
  criterias without redialing (after checking that 302 works)
- use the Python Config Class?
- use the Python Logging Class?

+ ignore messages which are not related (Call-ID) to the current running
  test cases (store Call-IDs and drop other replies?! (requests can be 
  processed but replies without dialog are problematic)
  - fix: if thus unrelated replies are dropped and not stored somewhere
    the next try to send a message ends with "bad filedescriptor" for any
	calls to the socket?!
	(presumably because the socket is closed because the socket object is
	 not referenced any more)
+ TCP support
  - fix: adding late data, e.g. body
  - fix: missing content-length = return nothing but wait for additional data
