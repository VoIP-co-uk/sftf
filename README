SIP Forum Test Framework
------------------------

This repo contains version 0.9.3 of the SIP Forum Test Framework.  I was
looking for some SIP test software, and found that this framework was 
quite tricky to locate.  In the end, I found a .tar.gz on the Wayback
Machine and decided that this code should be more visible.
